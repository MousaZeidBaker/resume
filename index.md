## About me

I'm motivated to constantly develop my skills, increase my knowledge and to grow
professionally. I'm confident in my ability to deliver creative solutions where
I can apply my technical expertise. My primarily skills lie within the field of
Cloud Computing, Infrastructure as code (IaC), Software Architecture and plain
Software Development. I'm also interested in Artificial Intelligence,
specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Through these experiences I
gained great insight and ability to adapt quickly, think critically and solve
problems creatively.

## Currently

I'm an experienced Solutions Architect at [Moodagent](https://moodagent.com/),
based in Copenhagen, Denmark. My role includes, but is not limited to, designing
& implementing innovative solutions, building robust & scalable infrastructure
and automating various processes.

## Projects
__AWS Lambda Typing__

[aws-lambda-typing](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/aws-lambda-typing) is a
package that provides type hints for AWS Lambda event, context and response
objects in Python.

__PoetryUp__

[poetryup](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/poetryup) updates dependencies and
bumps their version in the `pyproject.toml` file with respect to their version
constraint. Basically an addition to [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a
tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

__SecretsManager__

[sm](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/sm) is an open-source self-hosted secrets
manager with zero cost. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and web app
hosted in
[Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#managed-nextjs-with-vercel) while
secrets are securely stored in AWS Parameter Store.

## Experience
`Nov 2019-` __Moodagent__
Solutions Architect

Solutions Architect for a music streaming service where users are provided with
uniquely personalized playlists with help of machine learning. Worked with
designing and implementing new real-time recommendation services, in addition to
the non-real-time service, in order to get even better recommendations. Replaced
legacy solutions with microservice-oriented solutions. Dockerized services and
deployed containers into Kubernetes clusters in different regions. Introduced
Trunk-based development and continued to work with deploying services to new
regions with the plan to eventually run our service globally.

`Nov 2019-Nov 2020` __Moodagent__
Infrastructure Engineer

Infrastructure Engineer for a music streaming service where users are provided
with uniquely personalized playlists with help of machine learning. My main
responsibility was to build a new robust & scalable infrastructure for our
recommendation system. We decided to apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using
AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python. The architecture included AWS Step
Functions, EMR, SNS, SQS, Lambdas and DynamoDB to mention some. Implemented
state-of-the-art CI/CD pipelines to fully automate deployments. Worked with
expanding our services to new regions. Implemented AWS Step Functions to
orchestrate flows and automate jobs.

`Nov 2018-Nov 2019` __Axis Communications__
Software Engineer & DevOps Engineer

Part of a new cloud-native project within the field of audio. We started the
project from scratch and the goal was to develop a multi-site serverless
solution for voice messaging, music streaming, warning system etc. The platform
setup included network speakers and other audio devices. The architecture of
choice was microservice-oriented with Pub/Sub pattern in order to ensure an
event-driven application. Various AWS resources were used in our solution such
as AppSync for GraphQL API, SNS topics & SQS queues for Pub/Sub pattern, Lambdas
for serverless implementation and DynamoDB as database. This design enabled our
application to quickly scale in response to demand. We used The AWS Cloud
Development Kit (AWS CDK) framework together with TypeScript to model and build
our cloud infrastructure.

`Jun 2016-Nov 2018` __Axis Communications__
Software Engineer

Developer within a cloud-based surveillance solution for security and alarm
monitoring companies. The platform setup included network video cameras and a
variety of analytics and security devices. I had the time to be part of two
agile teams, one backend and one frontend, with a main focus on the backend.
With time I got an important role as an API specialist where I had the
opportunity to both design and implement JSON RESTful APIs. The old code base
was in PHP while new microservices were in Node.js. For our REST API:s we used
Laravel, a PHP framework that follows the model–view–controller architectural
pattern. A MySQL database was used and the cloud was modeled and set up with
Terraform.

`Jan 2016-Jun 2016` __Sony Mobile Communications__
Master's Degree Project

The main goal of the thesis was to investigate how to use Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data in order to increase the number of
training examples to train a classifier. GANs are neural networks that analyzes
data from a certain distribution in order to generate similar data. A
conditional DCGAN was implemented using TensorFlow, the convolutional neural
network (CNN) classifier was pre- implemented with Caffe’s .prototxt format in
NVIDIA DIGITS.

`Jun 2015-Sep 2015` __Ericsson Stockholm__
Internship

Worked with deep learning within the department of Cloud platform HDS. Various
of deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn,
Torch etc were used to model different types of artificial neural networks. From
simple fully connected neural networks (NN) to recurrent neural networks (RNN)
for predicting utilization levels and failures in Data Center installations.
